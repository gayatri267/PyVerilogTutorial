Pyverilog
==============================

Python-based Hardware Design Processing Toolkit for Verilog HDL
Pyverilog is an open-source hardware design processing toolkit for Verilog HDL.

This software includes various tools for Verilog HDL design.
* vparser: Code parser to generate AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) from source codes of Verilog HDL.
* dataflow: Dataflow analyzer with an optimizer to remove redundant expressions and some dataflow handling tools.
* controlflow: Control-flow analyzer with condition analyzer that identify when a signal is activated.
* ast\_code\_generator: Verilog HDL code generator from AST(Abstract Syntax Tree).

You can create your own design analyzer, code translator and code generator of Verilog HDL based on this toolkit.
